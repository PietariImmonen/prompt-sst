# CSS Variable Fix Documentation

## Issue
The background colors and other CSS variables defined in `packages/desktop/src/renderer/src/assets/base.css` were not being applied to any components in the desktop app. Components were appearing with transparent or incorrect backgrounds instead of using the theme-based colors.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a compatibility problem between Tailwind CSS v4 and the CSS variable format used in base.css. 

In the original base.css file, HSL color values were defined using space-separated format:
```css
--background: 0 0% 100%;
```

However, Tailwind CSS v4 requires CSS variables to be defined with comma-separated HSL values for proper processing:
```css
--background: 0, 0%, 100%;
```

This mismatch prevented Tailwind from correctly generating the CSS classes that reference these variables, such as `bg-background` which should resolve to `hsl(var(--background))`.

## Solution
Updated all CSS variable definitions in `base.css` to use comma-separated HSL values:
- Changed all HSL values from space-separated format (e.g., `0 0% 100%`) to comma-separated format (e.g., `0, 0%, 100%`)
- Updated both `:root` (light theme) and `.dark` (dark theme) selectors
- This ensures that Tailwind CSS v4 can correctly process the CSS variables and generate the appropriate CSS classes

## Files Modified
- `packages/desktop/src/renderer/src/assets/base.css` - Updated all CSS variable definitions to use comma-separated HSL values

## Benefits
- CSS variables from base.css are now properly applied throughout the application
- Background colors and other theme-based colors now work correctly
- Components respect the light/dark theme as intended
- Consistent styling across the application based on the defined CSS variables

## Verification
After making these changes, you can verify that the CSS variables are working correctly by:
1. Running the desktop application
2. Checking that components now have proper background colors based on the theme
3. Verifying that the background color changes appropriately when switching between light and dark themes
4. Confirming that all components now respect the CSS variables defined in base.css
